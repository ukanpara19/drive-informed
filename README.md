Project tile: Drive Informed

This project is about rendering the correct data on the view by using the financing data set of drive Informed in React. The features include filter and sorting of Data according to the input of range Slider and then applying sorting based on Monthyl payments.

I have made the use of only Emi value, as the the downpayement in the data is same for all the cars.

Component:  Header, Range Silder, Auto Card. 

Steps to run: 

1)Download the repo
1) Run - ``npm install`` (When running the project form the first time, this will install all the required dependencies)
2) Run - npm run informed 

Drive safe, Drive Informed !
